# [Medium] Max Array Sum

[Challenge Link](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/max-array-sum/problem)

Given an array of integers, find the subset of non-adjacent elements with the maximum sum. Calculate the sum of that subset. It is possible that the maximum sum is , the case when all elements are negative.

### Example

The following subsets with more than  element exist. These exclude the empty subset and single element subsets which are also valid.

Subset      Sum
[-2, 3, 5]   6
[-2, 3]      1
[-2, -4]    -6
[-2, 5]      3
[1, -4]     -3
[1, 5]       6
[3, 5]       8
The maximum subset sum is . Note that any individual element is a subset as well.


In this case, it is best to choose no element: return .
